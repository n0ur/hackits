<center>Terms of Agreement</center>
<p><u><b>Hackits Registration</b></u></p>
<p>You are about to create a Hackits account, which will allow you to participate in the forums, keep track of completed challenges, courses, ranking lists and achievements. This account is free of charge, and will always be.<br />
The Hackits team tries to provide a legally safe, educational and mostly fun environment for everbody to showcase and develop their skillset as a Hacker. This requires some basic rules to be set:</p>
<ol>
<li>Users are responsible for any content they create on the Hackits website, Hackits staff cannot be held liable for any of this user-created information. Content that is deemed inappropriate or illegal will be edited or removed by Hackits Staff, in extreme cases the user account may be terminated by an Administrator.</li>
<li>While we understand that the information presented on this website can be used to cause harm, we strongly disagree with any illegal (blackhat) activities. All information provided on the forum, challenges and courses is intended for educational purposes only. Following the law will always be your own responsibility. Use your knowledge for good, and good things will be bestowed upon you.</li>
<li>Check your local laws on computer security and your ISP's policy if you want to be absolutely sure you are not doing anything illegal by visiting this website. Some countries (Germany, UK) will not even allow you to own security tools such as nmap <a href="http://nmap.org/book/legal-issues.html">[Source]</a>.</li>
<li>We encourage you to test the security of the Hackits server, however bruteforcing or employing (distributed) denial of service attacks is not condoned. Any attack clearly intended for disruptive or destructive effects will be reported to the relevant authorities.</li>
<li>Hackits staff can at any time change these rules, any such modifications will be announced in the 'Announcements' forum section.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please inform us at staff@hackits.be should you note an infringement of the above before we do, so we can take action as soon as possible.</p>
<p><u><b>Security and Disclosure</b></u></p>
<p>Hackits staff makes sure that it is always running the latest stable version and security fixes of all its public-facing software, such as OpenSSL, Apache HTTPD, MySQL and PHP. Shell access is restricted to two staff members (Sling and Jupiter) and all actions on the system are logged. Physical access is restricted to the server owner (Sling). Encrypted backups of both filesystem and database are sent to an offsite location on a daily basis and tested regularly, a mirrored raid disk helps to prevent data loss during operation. Other security measures such as network and kernel hardening, firewalling, anti-bruteforce ban mechanisms, and 24/7 incident monitoring are employed to make the server as secure as possible.</p>
<p>Also, the site is only available over SSL, which will make sure that all the information sent over an untrusted network is at least encrypted and your username and password will not be snooped by automated password sniffers on for example public WiFi networks.</p>
<p>However, all information submitted to this system, including both public (such as post contents and your username) and private (such as your encrypted password and private messages) is subject to unforeseen security breaches and limitations affecting every public server on the internet. You should not use a password that is also used for another service, such as your e-mail account. Even though this should be common sense, many people unfortunately still do.</p>
<p>Any (potential) leaks of information will be publically announced, we strongly believe in public disclosure of such events.</p>
<p><u><b>Copyright Infringement</b></u></p>
<p>If you believe that content available on the Hackits website infringes one or more of your copyrights, please notify us by sending an email to staff@hackits.be with links to the relevant content and a reference to your copyright information. We will investigate the claim and take down the content if necessary.</p>
<p><u><b>But most importantly...</b></u></p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
